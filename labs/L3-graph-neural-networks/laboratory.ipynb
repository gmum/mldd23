    "Three components are necessary to train a neural network:\n",
    "1. neural network architecture\n",
    "2. loss function\n",
    "3. optimization algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "All these components can be easily implemented using one of the deep learning libraries for Python, e.g. PyTorch, TensorFlow, or JAX. You can find also some higher-level libraries built on top of these low-level libraries, e.g. Kera or Sonnet for TensorFlow or Haiku for JAX. We will be using PyTorch and PyTorch-Geometric to build graph neural networks.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Neural network architecture: model capacity and inductive bias\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks usually consist of layers, i.e. a network is a sequence of neural layers that transform the input representation. The most basic layer in neural networks is probably a **linear** or **fully-connected layer**. All input features are connected to all layer output features (neurons), and the strength of these connections is learned when the network is trained. Mathematically, we can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "[x_1, \\dots, x_n] \\cdot \\begin{bmatrix} \n",
    "w_{11} & \\cdots & w_{1m} \\\\\n",
    "\\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n",
    "w_{n1} & \\cdots & w_{nm}\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix} = \\mathbf{x}^T W = \\mathbf{y}^T =[y_1, \\dots, y_m],\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ is the layer input, and $\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathbb{R}^m$ is the layer output. \n",
    "$W\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times m}$ are layer parameters called **weights**. Usually a **bias** term is added to the transformed output, i.e. $\\mathbf{x}^T W + \\mathbf{b}^T$. Let's note that single output neurons follow the equation similar to linear regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y_k = x_1 w_{1k} + x_2 w_{2k} + \\cdots + x_n w_{nk} + b_k\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important class of layers are **non-linear layers** (or **activation layers**). They usually don't contain trainable parameters and are used only to introduce non-linearity to the model. Without them, only linear depenencies could be learned, so the network wouldn't be able to learn anything more than a simple linear regression. Currently, the most widely used activation is **ReLU** (Rectified Linear Unit) because of its effectiveness in terms of the computational cost and training outcomes. The ReLU layer is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "ReLU(x) = \\max(x,0) = \\begin{cases} x & \\text{dla } x \\geq 0,\\\\ 0 & \\text{dla } x < 0. \\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important type of non-linearity is **sigmoid**, which is less effective computation-wise. Sigmoid was used also in the logistic regression for binary classification. It returns numbers in the range (0, 1), which can be treated as positive class probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loss function: problem definition and optimization target\n",
    "\n",
    "The neural architecture defines the transformations that the network is capable of performing, but it doesn't define the training task itself. To determine what our network should learn, we will need a **loss function**, which is an optimization target. It's a function that will me minimized (rarely maximized) by modifying network parameters (weights).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for the regression problem, a standard loss function is the mean squared error (MSE) that measures the average error of all predictions, squared:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{X}|\\Theta)=\\mathrm{MSE}(\\mathcal{X}|\\Theta) = \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{X}|} \\sum_{i=1}^{|\\mathcal{X}|} e_i^2 = \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{X}|} \\sum_{i=1}^{|\\mathcal{X}|} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 = \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{X}|} \\sum_{i=1}^{|\\mathcal{X}|} (y_i - f(\\mathbf{x}_i|\\Theta))^2\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be minimizing this function with respect to the parameters $\\Theta$, which are network weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Theta^* = {\\arg \\min}_\\Theta \\,\\, \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{X}|\\Theta)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimization algorithm: method to reach the minimum of the loss function\n",
    "\n",
    "Having defined the architecture and loss function, we need to choose an algorithm that will find optimal model parameters. In the classical machine learning, we oftentimes analytically derived the formulas to find optimal parameters. The diversity and complexity of neural networks make it infeasible to find such solutions for these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we can use **gradient optimization** methods, which compute the loss function gradients (derivatives) w.r.t. the model parameters and move these parameters towards the direction opposite to the gradient (if our goal is to minimize the loss function). It is possible because of the differentiability of all operations in a neural network and the **chain rule**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most standard algorithm is **SGD** (Stochastic Gradient Descent):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Theta \\leftarrow \\Theta - \\eta \\nabla \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{X}|\\Theta),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\eta$ is learning rate, which can be selected for a specific task (it's a hyperparameter). The SGD method is the most basic, and many follow-up methods have been implemented in deep learning libraries. For example, **Momentum** is a technique that accumulates past gradients to accelerate the convergence and to avoid local minima.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "v \\leftarrow \\gamma v + \\eta \\nabla \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{X}|\\Theta), \\\\\n",
    "\\Theta \\leftarrow \\Theta - v.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The momentum constant $\\gamma$ is usually set to 0.9 (it should be less than 1 to gradually decrease the momentum).\n",
    "\n",

    "**Recap:** In mathematics, a graph is an object that consists of a set of vertices (nodes) connected with edges, i.e. $\\mathcal{G} = (V, E)$, where $V = \\{ v_i: i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N \\} \\}$ and $E \\subseteq \\{ (v_i, v_j):\\, v_i,v_j \\in V \\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Molecular graphs are a special class of graphs, where besides nodes (denoting atoms) and edges (denoting chemical bonds), we have an additional information about atom types and sometimes also bond types. We can assume that we have an additional set of node/atom features encoded as a matrix $X$, where $X_{ij}$ is the $j$-th feature of the $i$-th atom. As atomic features, we can have one-hot encoded atom symbols (a vector containing zeros on all positions besides the position that corresponds to the atom symbol), the number of implicit hydrogens bonded with this atom, or the number of heavy neighbors (atoms other than hydrogens bonded to the given atom).\n",
    "\n",
    "Egdes/bonds can be encoded in two different ways. One method is to use an adjacency matrix $A$, where $A_{ij}=1$ if nodes/atoms $v_i$ nad $v_j$ are connected ($A_{ij}=0$ otherwise). In the case of sparse matrices, a more useful encoding is a list of pairs of connected atoms (a list of index pairs). This latter enocding is used by the PyTorch-Geometric library.\n",

    "In many applications of machine learning, it is crucial to understand model predictions. For example, it is important to understand why our model predicted toxicity if we want to improve the chemical structure and get rid of this liability. In graph neural networks, we can create an importance map overlayed on top of the chemical structure to point at the atoms important for the prediction.\n",

    "Grad-CAM is an explainability method developed for convolutional neural networks (images), and can be adapted to graph convolutions. The representation after the last graph layer is called an **activation map** $F$, where $F_{i,j}$ represents the $i$-th feature of the $j$-th atom. To find out which atomic features correlate with the prediction, we can compute gradients of the predicted class probability w.r.t. the activation map features. Next, these gradients $\\alpha$ are multiplied by the values in the activation maps to calculate per-atom importances.\n",
